# GPL licensed files, unknown version

The files listed below in this repository are either direct copies of
files from this repository:

* https://sourceforge.net/p/sdaaubckp/

or they are edited from the originals by me, but retain their original
license as derived works from the originals.  They say 'GPL' in
comments, without a version, so I am not sure which version of the GPL
license they were distributed under.

* src/orig/mwfview.py
* src/orig/mwfview-ser.py
* src/mwfview.py
* src/gen_data.py


# GPL version 2 or later

All files in the directory gaw3-20160305 were initially committed into
this repository as exact copies of the files extracted from here:

* [http://download.tuxfamily.org/gaw/download/gaw3-20160305.tar.gz](http://download.tuxfamily.org/gaw/download/gaw3-20160305.tar.gz)

Any commits later in this repository were made by the author of that
commit, but are definitely derived works of the original and thus
still under the same license as the original.
